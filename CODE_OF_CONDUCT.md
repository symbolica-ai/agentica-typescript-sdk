This Code of Conduct applies wherever the project is discussed or built, including repository issues and pull requests, code review, discussions, community channels, in-person meetups, and other spaces where you are participating in or representing the project.

Maintainers may take action at their discretion, including warnings, content removal, restricting participation, or removal from project spaces.

We may publish additional community rules or guidance over time, and we will make them easy to find. You are responsible for knowing and following the rules in effect.
